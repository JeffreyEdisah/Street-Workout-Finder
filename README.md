## Objectif
A project that allows users to geolocate street workout places near them and see detailed information about each place, such as its location, the equipment available, the state of the equipment, how frequented the place is, and more. Users can also contribute to the app by adding new street workout places that are not already included.

## Frontend
The frontend of this project is built using React.

## API Gateway
The API Gateway is used to handle requests and route them to the appropriate microservice. The technology used for the API Gateway has not yet been decided.

## Microservices
This project contains two microservices:

- User: responsible for handling user authentication and storing favorite street workout places.
- Places: responsible for managing the data of street workout places, including information about location, equipment, and popularity.

## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file for each component (frontend, API gateway, and microservices).
